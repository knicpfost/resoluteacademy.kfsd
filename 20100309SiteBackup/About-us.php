<blockquote>
<blockquote><font face="Verdana"><img style="margin: 10px" alt="" title="" src="images/cobyresolute.jpg" align="left" height="139" width="130" />Coby Cathey, president of Resolute Academy graduated from Harding
University and East Texas State University.&nbsp; <br />
<br />Coby
has served as a
teacher at the middle school and high school levels.&nbsp; While teaching
Astronomy at Newman Smith High School in Carrollton, TX, he created the
Newman Smith Space Project.&nbsp; The project was an interdisciplinary
all-school activity, involving over 2500 students in a mission to
create a space simulator that would house 4 student astronauts, 72
hours.&nbsp; The project received regional and national attention as an
innovative and landmark experience for students and educators alike.&nbsp;
As a result, Coby received local and national recognition including
awards from NASA and the National Science Teachers Association.<br />
<br />Coby served as an assistant principal and principal in several
at-risk schools.&nbsp; He repeatedly saw students that were negatively
impacted by the state testing as he describes in his own words.<br />
<br /></font>
<blockquote><font face="Verdana">&quot;I
would see students that had completed all of the required coursework,
yet could not pass the state testing.&nbsp; There were a variety of reason,
but the unfortunate thing was these students were being held back,
unable to achieve their dreams, left with a bad taste about the
educational system.</font><br />
</blockquote>
<blockquote><font face="Verdana">Initially, I thought they should just try harder.&nbsp; I developed
several instructional strategies to assist students in the process.&nbsp; It
wasn't until I really analyzed the available tests and realized it was
a system that was inherently broken and designed to see a certain
number of students fail.&nbsp; Let me say that again, the system in place,
is designed to insure that a certain number of students will NEVER be
successful.&nbsp; Where is the research to indicate state testing improves
the quality of student, their work ethic, the quality of education or
has any benefit?&nbsp; The only benefit of state testing is to the test
makers and the lobbiests and politicians that favor such.&nbsp; The current
practice is a travesty and a farce as millions of dollars are being
spent annually.&nbsp; <br />
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font face="Verdana">
The weakest members of society, those with the smallest voice,
at-risk and disadvantaged students, are the ones that are suffering the
most in the current system.&nbsp; </font><br />
<font face="Verdana"></font><br />
<font face="Verdana">I created Resolute Academy to see
that students receive the recognition for their 12 years of work and
dedication.&nbsp; It is my prayer that every student that has a negative
feeling about education finds a way to see their full potential and
find a path that works for them.&nbsp; I believe Resolute Academy can be
that path.&quot;</font><br />
</blockquote><font face="Verdana"><br />
Coby has also conducted
training sessions for educators and administrators on a wide range of
topics including classroom management, safety, student motivation,
parenting and curriculum design.</font></blockquote></blockquote></td>
