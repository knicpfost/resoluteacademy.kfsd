Add directory capabilities and other functionality to the great <a href="http://www.gravityforms.com/?r=subscriptions" rel="nofollow">Gravity Forms</a> plugin.

== Description ==

> This plugin requires the <a href="http://www.gravityforms.com/?r=subscriptions" rel="nofollow">Gravity Forms plugin</a>. <strong>Don't use Gravity Forms? <a href="http://www.gravityforms.com/?r=subscriptions" rel="nofollow">Buy the plugin</a></strong> and then use this plugin!

### Gravity Forms has great PayPal support built in, but...

There's no way to switch between subscriptions and one-time payments in the same form, or modify the subscription frequency. That's what this add-on does: it adds two buttons to the Gravity Forms form editor that add a drop-down menu or radio button selection with subscription options.

You can use the presets or enter your own subscription frequency options. You can define options such as:

* One-Time (non-subscription)
* Once Daily
* Once Weekly
* Once a Month
* Once Every 6 Months
* Once Yearly
* etc.
